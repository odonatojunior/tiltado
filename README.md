_Tiltado_ is a small plugin to make a div tilt based on the mouse movement. This is just a way to keep my Javascript knowledge fresh

## Usage

Just import the script in the `dist` folder and add `data-tiltado` at everything you want to tilt

```html
<div data-tiltado>
  <h1>I'm tilted</h1>
</div>
```

## Todo

- [x] Use JSDoc for better DX
- [x] Migrate it to Typescript for an even better DX
- [ ] Find a better way to write some of the functions with SOLID patterns
- [ ] Create tags and things related to the release of this project (_usando canh√£o pra matar barata_)
- [ ] Create a build process with GitHub Actions
